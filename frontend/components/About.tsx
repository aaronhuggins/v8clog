          On June 17, the V8 team at Google{" "}

            announced they would be discontinuing release posts

          via their blog and Twitter. The recommended way of getting at
          changelogs for V8? Look at the{" "}
          <a href="https://chromestatus.com/roadmap">Chrome Status website</a>
          {" "}
          for all Chrome changes, and check out the git repository logs. For
          reasons that I feel are obvious, not everyone who uses the V8
          JavaScript engine cares about Google Chrome.

          Naturally, there are a lot of projects which benefit from V8 and which
          don't touch Google Chrome itself; Node.js, Deno, Cloudflare, to name a
          few. When looking at runtimes on top of the engine, the biggest
          concern I have is "what is the latest changes to V8 that is included
          with this version?" Knowing that prepares me, at least partly, to
          understand the impact to my code running on top of the engine.

              I am that interested, but I do *not* want to have to wade through
              all the other changes for Chromium just for V8.<br />
              <br />Hopefully, I have time next week to look at whipping up a
              changelog scraper... Might end up being my first Deno Deploy app.

          I chose the name "V8 Clog" because the word "clog" actually has a
          history of use referring to changelogs. That, and also because I felt
          that the team was "clogging up the works" by no longer making release
          blog posts. Do please try to have a sense of humor, folks.
